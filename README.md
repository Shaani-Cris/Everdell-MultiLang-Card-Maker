# Everdell Custom Card Builder

This project is an adaptation of [adfergy/everdell_card_builder](https://github.com/adfergy/everdell_card_builder).

## Features
- **Multilanguage support**: the “critter type” field (e.g., *Common Critter*, *Unique Construction*) is now editable, so you can create cards in any language.
- **Extended copies**: allows up to **4 occurrences** of a card (instead of the original 2–3).

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Edit fields, upload background images, and generate your custom Everdell cards.  
4. Download your card as a PNG for printing.
